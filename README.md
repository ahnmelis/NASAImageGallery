Coding Challenge for Capital One Summit

Deployed site: https://nasa-image-gallery.herokuapp.com/

My finished submission is a Maven project coded using Eclipse (Tomcat server) and then deployed to Heroku. On the home page,  the user will be able to make a search by phrase and/or year period and/or location.  They can also access their session history by clicking "Search History" on the top right corner.  After clicking the search button, the user will be brought to a results page with the resulting pictures and titles arranged in a table (If no pictures matched the criteria, an appropriate message is displayed). The user can click on any of the pictures to be brought to a details page that has extended information about the picture. 

By the search bars is a Google Maps icon that when clicked will pull up a map for the user's location reference. NOTE: For some odd reason, the map will not always be loaded and the page will look blank. Refreshing the current page will fix this issue, otherwise, the user should click to the far left or right to exit out of the map overlay.
